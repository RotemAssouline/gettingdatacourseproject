This is my submission for the final exercise of the "Getting and cleaning data" course.

The script run_analysis.R reads the data from the /data folder and writes the file "means.txt", which can be found in this repo.

The main steps performed by the run_analysis script are:
  1. Reading the data into dataframes.
  2. Merging the train and test data into a single data set, which also contains subject and activity columns.
  3. Renaming the columns of the main dataframe.
  4. Creating a new dataframe with the means of each measurement for each subject and each activity.

I hope that the script is clear, and would like to thank my peers for taking the time to grade my assignment.
